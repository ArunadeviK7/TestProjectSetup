CHAPTER II
Principles
Article 5
Principles relating to processing of personal data
1. Personal data shall be:
(a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (‘lawfulness, fairness and
transparency’);
(b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible
with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research
purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with
the initial purposes (‘purpose limitation’);
(c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (‘data
minimisation’);
(d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that
are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay
(‘accuracy’);
4.5.2016 EN Official Journal of the European Union L 119/35
(
1
) Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the
provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services (OJ L 241, 17.9.2015, p. 1).
(e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for
which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data
will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or
statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and
organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject
(‘storage limitation’);
(f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against
unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical
or organisational measures (‘integrity and confidentiality’).
2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (‘accountability’).
